Greeks Visualization:

Delta, Gamma, Vega, Theta, Rho: Create surface plots or heatmaps for each Greek. You could plot, for instance, the variation of Delta with respect to the underlying asset price and volatility or other combinations like time to maturity and interest rate.
3D Surface Plot for Call/Put Price:

Plot the option price as a function of two varying parameters, like spot price and time to maturity, or volatility and interest rate. This will give a more holistic view of how multiple parameters affect the option price.
Sensitivity Analysis Heatmaps:

Display how sensitive the option price is to each parameter. For example, you could create a heatmap that shows the change in price when the interest rate or time to maturity changes.
Parameter Dependency Plot:

Plot the option price against time to maturity for different fixed volatilities or spot prices. This helps to visualize how time decay impacts the option price.
Animation:

If your tool supports it, create an animation that shows how option prices evolve as time to maturity decreases (or how the Greeks evolve).
Volatility Smile Curve:

Plot the implied volatility against different strikes for a fixed maturity to visualize the volatility smile or skew.
Contour Plots:

Instead of heatmaps, use contour plots for call/put prices or Greeks, varying two parameters. These plots offer a clearer interpretation of different levels in terms of value changes.
Scenario Analysis Dashboard:

Create interactive sliders for spot price, volatility, time to maturity, and interest rate to allow for dynamic visualizations of how the Black-Scholes price or Greeks change when these inputs are adjusted.
